# Unfollower-Checker-Python
A script that checks who unfollowed you on Instagram using Selenium and Python. This script was used in a video tutorial on my YouTube channel.

I edited the original code made by TopNotchProgrammer (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ji0ap_EeSOQ)
When downloading the followers.txt file, remove the written text. I added that so GitHub would accept the empty file.
